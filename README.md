Perun is an open source project that aims to increase blockchain transaction
throughput by using just a handful of main chain transactions to move an entire
peer-to-peer network of activity off the main chain.  After an initial setup of
a set of basic transaction channels, this network lets any participant transact
with any other participant via virtual channels which do not require additional
on-chain setup.  We do this by implementing the 
[Perun protocol](https://perun.network/), which has been formally proven to
allow for secure off-chain transactions.


## Project Status

At the moment the perun-node is neither ready for production nor does it
implement the complete perun protocol yet. But with basic features available,
the project is at a stage where you can try it out and start to get involved.

This is a complete re-implementation of the previous version (available under
the previous name of the project: dst-go) in branch
[legacy/master](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-node/tree/legacy/master).
This version builds on top of the [go-perun](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun) SDK that implements a state
channel client based on perun protocol. See Description for more details.

## Description

The perun-node is multi-user state channel node that can be used for opening,
transacting on and closing state channels. It builds on the state channel
client implemented by
[go-perun](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun) and implements the
following functionalities:

1. Payment App: For using perun protocol to establish and use bi-directional
payment channels.
2. ID Provider: For the user to define a list of known participants in
the off-chain network.
3. Key management: For managing the cryptographic keys of the user.
4. User session: For allowing multiple users to use a single node, each with
a dedicated key manager and ID provider.
5. User API interface: For the user to interact with the perun-node.

The current version provides the following features:

|Feature | Implementation |
|:--|:--|
|Blockchain Backend|Ethereum|
|Key management|Ethereum keystore |
|ID Provider|Local |
|User API|Two Party Payment API |
|User API Adapter|gRPC |
|Persistence|LevelDB|
|Currencies|ETH, Any ERC20 token|

This project currently contains three executable packages located in the `cmd` directory.

- `perunnode`: An app for starting a running instance of perun node. It can
  also generate configuration artifacts for trying out the node.

- `perunnodecli` is an app with interactive CLI interface that serves two purposes:
    - easy way to try out payment channel API.
    - reference implementation for using the generated grpc client stubs for
      payment channel API.

- `perunnodetui` is an app with interactive text based user interface. With
  visual representation most of the actions, it is easy way to try out payment
  channel API and understand the perun protocol.

For a tutorial on using perun-node with `perunnodecli`, see the
[tutorial section](https://labs.hyperledger.org/perun-doc/node/introduction.html#user-guide)
on the project documentation website.

For a tutorial on using perun-node with `perunnodetui`, see
[this section](cmd/perunnodetui/README.md). A talk on overview of perun,
including a hands-on demo of using the perunnode with `perunnodetui` can be
found [here](https://youtu.be/sASYSJm3QKw?t=916).

## Getting Started

Install the following pre-requisites.

    1. Go (v1.19 or later).
    2. ganache-cli (v6.9.1 or later).

Clone the project and sync the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-node.git
cd perun-node
go mod tidy
```

Start the ganache-cli node for running integration tests:

```bash
# These funded accounts will be used in tests. "-b 1" configures the
# ganache-cli node to mine one block every second. It is required as our
# contracts use blockchain based timeout for settling a state channel on-chain.
ganache-cli -b 1 \
--account="0x1fedd636dbc7e8d41a0622a2040b86fea8842cef9d4aa4c582aad00465b7acff,100000000000000000000" \
--account="0xb0309c60b4622d3071fad3e16c2ce4d0b1e7758316c187754f4dd0cfb44ceb33,100000000000000000000"
```

Run the linter and tests from the project root directory:

```bash
# Lint
golangci-lint run ./...

# Test
go test -tags=integration -count=1 -p=1 ./...

# Build perunnode and perunnodecli binaries
make
```
